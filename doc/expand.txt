PROVIDES						*expand-provides*

Mappings:
<Leader>ex or <Plug>ExpandVariable
	Expand expressions.

<Leader>ev or <Plug>EvalExpression
	Evaluate expressions.

SETTINGS						*expand-settings*

DISABLES

Variables:
g:loaded_expand
	When exists, does nothing. Use to disable this plugin.

g:no_expand_maps
	When non-zero, doesn't register any effective mappings.

g:no_plugin_maps
	When non-zero, doesn't register any effective mappings. This variable
	may have an affect on mappings of other plugins. Use
	"g:no_expand_maps" to disable only mappings defined by this plugin.

KOWN ISSUES					*expand-knownissues*

For several option with top of '&' (see |:let-&|), may be expanded to an
irrelevant value. E.g. "&statusline", "&tabline" etc. When an option is
expanded incorrectly, use evaluating instead. This is the issue of VIM itself,
not the other way around the one of this plugin.
